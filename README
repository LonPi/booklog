The program is coded with python3
Tkinter and JSON library are assumed to be in-built

To compile and execute, use one of these methods:
Method 1:
python3 main.py

Method 2: Depends on machine/setup
python main.py

Method 3:
chmod +x main.py
./main.py

About the program:
- It is part of a log for bookstore keepers to track inventory stocks
- Features are limited to addition and view of inventory
- A filter for storybooks is available for view and addition of books as well

Learning Objectives:
LO1: Best practices for OO development in python
- The use of inheritance between Book and StoryBook, how storybooks inherits
    the book class which allows access of reusable values and methods via super
    found in item.py.
- The implementation of a graphical interface using tkinter was challenging but
    can be seen in the addition and view of the list of books in the system.
    The GUI enabled event driven programming.
- Lambda was implemented to allow code reuse on buttons to reduce the number of
    necessary function definitions. These can be found in main.py on functions
    with "event=None".
- A collection class Collection has been created to reduce high coupling between
    model classes to the GUI classes. The storage has been made private for
    encapsulation purposes.

LO2: Persistence utilization
- Object details are stored/saved as JSON onto a local file books.json for persistence
- Sample data are included with books.json, feel free to empty it.

LO3: Portability utilization
- Object details of all books are generated into JSON which allows portability
    onto other platforms if desired.
- String for validation has been printed onto the standard output of the
    terminal to be copied.
- Note that string for validation only comprises of non-storybooks not all books
    as seen in books.json which has both. This is due there only being two
    different objects dealt within the program.

User Stories:
- As a bookkeeper, I would like to keep track of inventory.
- As a bookkeeper, I want to save the inventory to next usage.
- As a bookkeeper, I want to load the inventory from previous usage.
- As a bookkeeper, I would like to have the inventory details saved locally.

Notes:
- Addition of books during filtered view will revert to normal view without unchecking
- You may press Esc to quit the program
- Program was tested on a Windows machine via Anaconda Prompt
- Purposed to learn python3 and tkinter
